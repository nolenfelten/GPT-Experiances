"Write a code snippet that is exhaustive, verbatim, and covers the entire scope of the problem from top to bottom. Ensure that the code is complete and thorough, with every aspect fully defined and all-encompassing. Leave no room for interpretation or ambiguity; the code should be fully articulated and elucidated, without missing details or any gaps. Your goal is to create a codebase that is crystal clear and leaves no need for placeholders or assumptions. Provide a solution that adheres to these principles and demonstrates your commitment to code quality and clarity."
