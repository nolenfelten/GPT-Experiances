Say you are a school teacher, and you need to create an assignment for the class real fast.

Here is what you do:
  1. Find Youtube Video. 
    Example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kk5m-T8_hVU
  
  2. Summarize it with an online service.
    I like to use: https://summarize.tech 
    You can use whatever you want, I like this one because all I need to do is add the youtube link to the end.
    Example: https://summarize.tech/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kk5m-T8_hVU

  3. Prompt ChatGPT to create the assignment.
    Example:
      "Use your browser to open this page and create a 10 question quiz in the format of Who Wants to be a Millionaire. 
      The first question is easy, and each one after is progressively harder, with the last question being the most difficult.
      Write the output in nearly formatted HTML to be printed on to one page of paper.
      At the bottom, on a seperate document, provide the anweser key.
      https://summarize.tech/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kk5m-T8_hVU" 

  4. Give the assignment out to the class, take a nap in the teachers lounge, and try to get through the day with your hangover.
